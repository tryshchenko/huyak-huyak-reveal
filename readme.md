# huyak-huyak-revealjs 🐓
Huyak-huyak is a russian slang world which means "Something done ASAP without big care about quality".

It gives you a production-ready configuration of reveal.js which I personally use as the scaffold. It ships with a simple.

## Solved problem
I always wanted to use configuration of reveal which is provided in the demo, because I really use most of plugins added there. So I made a boilerplate out of it and shared it with you.

## How to use
1.
```
npm install && npm start
```

2. Open localhost:3000 in your browser

## Difference with clean reveal.js
- It is simplified. I removed themes, logic for their selection, etc.
- Styles for logo of your company on the title page
- On set of fonts, which are available offline
- Built-in web server
- Simplified files structure
